### AAAI 2021: Overview

The total of 9,034 submissions to [AAAI 2021](https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-21/) marked another record high, surpassing last year’s 8800. Submissions from China (3,319) almost doubled the number of papers from the United States (1,822). Out of 7,911 papers that went to review, a total of 1,692 papers made it. This year’s acceptance rate was 21 percent, slightly higher than last year’s 20.6 percent.
